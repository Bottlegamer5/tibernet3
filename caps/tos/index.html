  <h2>The Bottle Cap Non-Proliferation Protocol</h2>

  <h3>February 2023</h3>

<p>This paper hereby clarifies the cap-legal standard for Bottle Cap collecting from now, until the END OF TIME ITSELF.</p>

  <h3>Bottle Caps</h3>
<p>From here on, the cap-legal definition of a ‘Bottle Cap’ is an object that meets the following criteria:</p>

<p>- The item is intended to be disposable<br>
- The item was designed to be used as a bottle cap and is designed in such a way that is plausible to be used as such.<br>
- The item MUST be a connecting piece that connects via a knurled screw mechanism or snap-fit or other mechanical means. It must not be only a stopper as these items do not qualify as cap-legal Bottle Caps. Corks and such are STRICTLY NOT cap-legal.<br>
<br>
Notable criteria that do qualify as cap-legal are:<br>
<br>
- The item may be made of any material, including metal which is commonly used for beer caps.<br>
- The item may be of any size.<br>
- The item may be manufactured by the capper [Bottle Cap Collector] and it will still be cap-legal.<br>
</p>
  </h3>Bottle Cap Standard</h3>
<p>From here on, cap-legal caps will be the only standard allowed in competitions of any kind tracked on websites such as <a href="https://captrack.netlify.app">https://captrack.netlify.app</a> or similar.<br>
<br>
  Cap-Legal caps may also be referred to as Match-Caps, Capper Caps or Good Caps.</p>
